# My React App

This is a React application that serves as the client-side of the project. Below are the details on how to set up and run the application.

## Getting Started

To get started with the client-side application, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd my-react-app/client
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   Make sure you have Node.js installed. Then run:
   ```bash
